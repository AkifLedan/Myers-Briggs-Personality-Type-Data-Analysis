# Myers-Briggs-Personality-Type-Data-Analysis
Analysis using Python of a dataset with over 8000 Myers-Briggs Personality Types and 50 online posts of the people the personality types are representing.

project_main.py contains all of the analyses and the machine learning model, as well as all the testing code.
word_cloud.py contains the function for creating Word Cloud data visualizations of the word frequencies for a given Myers-Briggs personality type from the datatest.

The other files primarily deal with cleaning up the data and getting it into usable formats for analysis.
